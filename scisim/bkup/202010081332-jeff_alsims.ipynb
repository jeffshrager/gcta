    "((Add instructions for this here))\n",
    "\n",
    "Set gpolicies globally. (Usually this will remain the same throughout a long set of runs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gpolicies = Dict(:ptw => ALSimAs.ptw_policy, :ts => ALSims.ts_policy, \n",
    "                 :ucb => ALSims.ucb_policy, :ura => ALSims.ura_policy)\n",

    "If you don't already have previous results saved in \"~/results/al_results.serialized\", \n",
    "then you need to create that directory in your home, and do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE RESULTS, USE ```bkupresults()``` instead:\n",
    "serialize(resultfile(\"al_results.serialized\"),[])\n",

    "\n",
    "(See more on storage, below)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Running\n",
    "\n",
    "See run(...). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model for interactions at the moment is that you have to say: int_flag=true, \n",
    "and then the bm x tx interactions will be automatically included. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Results storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works at the moment, is that whenever run(...) is called, the result \n",
    "is pushed on the front of gresults[] and then this is serialized into a file called \n",
    "\"~/results/al_results.serialized\".\n",
    "\n",
    "gresults will get auto-loaded when you run if it is null.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this, and the reason is was done this way, is that you'll generally run a few\n",
    "experiments, and then want to compare the results, using plotrun([x,y,z,...]) to create a grided display of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that gresults gets big, and takes a long time to (de)serialize. Therefore, there is a function called \n",
    "```bkupresults(label=\"astring\")``` that moves the current results to a labelled and time-stamped file, and clears them. \n",
    "In order to get them back, at \n",
    "the moment you have to manually mv the desired timestamped file back into al_results.serialized and reload it. \n",
    "(Obviously there should be a restore() function, but this whole scheme is getting thrown out soon anyway, so this is fine\n",
    "for the moment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to bkup the results without clearing them, in which case you can say clear=false (then you don't need really=true).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the bkups using listbkups(), and recover one using recoverbkup(\"full_file_name\"). Usually the full_file_name will be\n",
    "copy-pasted from the output of listbkups(), which just basically does an ls on the results directory. Warning: Recoverbkup won't let you destroy the current results, unless they are empty, but you can use force=true if you want to over-ride this. (The usual reason\n",
    "for using force=true is that you just recovered a bkup, and don't want to have to re-store it in another bkup.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So reset the in-core and store results (gresults, and the al_results.serialized file) without having to back them up, you can CAREFULLY use: resetresults(really=yes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The clobberesults(n) function removes the nth result (per listersults() numbering). It does NOT, however, actually re-save gresults,\n",
    "so if you below it, you have a change to recover by reloading gresults using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gresults = deserialize(resultfile(\"al_results.serialized\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time you run(), gresults wiil be dumped, so any clobbering you've done will become permanent at that time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: Some of the most destructive functions have an annoying required really=true argument...for obvious reasons! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting results\n",
    "\n",
    "Run() plots its one result, but plotrun(...) will plot a desired result.  Listresults() show the loaded results (in gresults), and \n",
    "then plotrun(n) will plot the nth gresult (1 being the latest/top/first one). If you give plotrun(...) an arrary argument, like:\n",
    "plotrun([3,2,4,5,6]), it will grid the plots in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. The optional keyword argument: figsize=(n,m) \n",
    "So, plotrun([1,2]) will usually do the thing you want, which is to compare the last two runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a meta-experiment. Note that the label passed to run can be an arbitrary string, but \n",
    "the one passed to bkupresults() should be something compatible with a file name, so I would aviod spaces \n",
    "and special chars in that case. Note the use of ylimit to put all the gridded plots on the same scale.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function runall()\n",
