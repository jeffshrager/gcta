	abstract = {Rank aggregation has recently been proposed as a useful abstraction that has several applications, including meta-search, synthesizing rank functions from multiple indices, similarity search, and classiﬁcation. In database applications (catalog searches, ﬁelded searches, parametric searches, etc.), the rankings are produced by sorting an underlying database according to various ﬁelds. Typically, there are a number of ﬁelds that each have very few distinct values, and hence the corresponding rankings have many ties in them. Known methods for rank aggregation are poorly suited to this context, and the difﬁculties can be traced back to the fact that we do not have sound mathematical principles to compare two partial rankings, that is, rankings that allow ties.},
